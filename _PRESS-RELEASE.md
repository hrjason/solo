There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Heyo an interactive way to discover and share content with your friends!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Heyo's main demographic involves young teens to young adults looking to get meaningful content from their friends rather than ads and nonsense. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Heyo is a social media platform built on found content. Want to share a song or article with a friend with the convenience of letting them listen or view it whenever they have a moment? Heyo allows for flexible and private sharing to your network, without the added noise of ad-algorithms and other social algorithms blocking you from what's important. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  The problem Heyo solves is four fold: 
  1) It gives the user freedom from their newsfeed, allowing them to view what they've received when they want.
  2) Reminders to check on sent content.
  3) No ad or friend's algorithms cluttering or blocking your experience with your network. 
  4) Typical newsfeeds have a lot of garbage to reflect the user's life, from stupid statuses to social media hacks. The overall experience is lacklsuter. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Heyo solves these problems (in the previous order):
  1) It has a Stack List allowing you to view the content when you want.
  2) Because it's set up in a list format.  Viewing or Deleting the item would be required in order to be removed from the list. This is beneficial in that users often forgot to revisit messages and e-mail systems.
  3) Because it's built off a one-to-one relationship, there is no hinderance between two users!
  4) Because the system is entirely built off found content, garbage statuses or hacks arent applicable!

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Finally freedom from the newsfeed leash! View content as you please and avoid pregnant girls at Walmart's statuses!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Getting started is as simple as signing up for an account, finding your friends on facebook (or through your contacts), and sending content in the form of links or utilizing our Chrome or iPhone plugins!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "This app single handedly improved my IQ, and focused my attention on the virality of social media rather than the noise" 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  if this entices you, the app will be available on our website as well as in the app store for both Droid and Apple.
